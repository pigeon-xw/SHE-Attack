# SHE-Attack
This is an attack on the SHE encryption algorithm, which requires Sage for execution. You can use the online platform https://cocalc.com/features/sage to run it. 

We recommend downloading SageMath and running the code locally, as the online platform may experience delays in generating random prime numbers.
