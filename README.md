# SHE-Attack

This project aims to demonstrate a successful attack on iSHE under small parameter settings. To the best of our knowledge, large and appropriate parameter selection is still required to ensure the security of the SHE family.

You can use the online platform https://cocalc.com/features/sage to run it. We recommend downloading SageMath and running the code locally, as the online platform may experience delays in generating random prime numbers.
